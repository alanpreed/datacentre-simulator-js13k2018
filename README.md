# Datacentre Simulator
An entry for the JS13k games competition 2018.

You work in the data-centre for Peruvian Web Services, monitoring their servers.
The equpiment is old and ineffective, so reguarly requires manual intervention to keep running. Can you make sure that connections receive packets fast enough to prevent the data centre from going *offline*?
