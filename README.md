# Datacentre simulator
An entry for the JS13k games competition 2018.

You work in the data-centre for Peruvian Web Services monitoring their servers.
The equpiment is old and ineffective so reguarly requires intervention. Can you make sure connections get enough packets quick enough before the data centre goes *offline*
